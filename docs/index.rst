Heaven Documentation
====================

Welcome to the Heaven project documentation.

This project demonstrates **GitHub Actions automation** for continuous integration,
deployment, dependency management, code review, and documentation deployment.

-------------------------------

About This Project
-------------------------------

The Heaven project automates the software development workflow using GitHub Actions.
It includes workflows for:

* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Deployment Pipeline
* Scheduled Tasks
* Dependency Updates
* Code Review Automation
* Documentation Deployment

-------------------------------

How It Works
-------------------------------

Whenever you push changes to the main branch:

1. Tests and linting are run automatically.
2. The deployment pipeline builds and deploys your app.
3. Scheduled tasks run periodically to maintain project stability.
4. Dependencies are automatically updated and tested.
5. Documentation (this page) is rebuilt and deployed to ReadTheDocs.
